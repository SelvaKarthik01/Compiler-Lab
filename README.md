List of Experiments:
1. Develop a scanner using LEX for recognizing the tokens in a given C program.
2. Develop a parser for all branching statements of 'C' programming language using LEX& YACC.
3. Develop a parserfor alllooping statements of 'C' programming language using LEX & YACC.
4. Develop a parser for complex statements in 'C' programming language with procedure calls and
array references using LEX & YACC.
5. Develop a program to find the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a given Context Free Grammar.
6. Extend the outcome of experiment 5 to implement a LL(1) parser in C or Java to decide whether the
input string is valid or not.
7. Implement a LR(1) bottom up parser in C or Java to decide whether the input string is valid or not
(Context- Free Grammar, Action andGOTO tables are suppliedas inputs).
8. Identify the structure of if-else statements in 'C' programming language that can be transformed
into their equivalent switch-case statements. Design and implement the Adhoc syntax directed
translation systemforthe identified case.
9. Use LEX and YACC to create two translators that would translate the given input (compound
expression) into three-address and postfix intermediate codes. The input and output of the
translators should be a file.
10. Write an optimizer pass in C or Java that does common-sub expression elimination on the three address
intermediate code generated in the previous exercise.
11. Use LEX & YACC to write a back end that traverses the three address intermediate code and generates
x86 code.
12. Implement Local List Scheduling Algorithm.
